        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>As a fifth-year EBP student at Kedge Business School in Bordeaux, I am currently completing my final year of my Master's program, in exchange, at the PFH Business School in Germany.

            During my studies, I was able to participate in a three-semester Erasmus exchange at the University of Limerick in Ireland. There, I expanded my English vocabulary while also gaining maturity and personal independence. 
            
            I was also able to complete two very interesting internships as being a Marketing and Communication assistant in a wine international group, and a Project Manager in a wonderful photo studio. 
            
            In February, I will finally come back at Kedge for completing my specialised Master in Purchase and Supply Chain. </p>
